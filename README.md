Maze Solver
It solves a given maze using a recursive backtracking algorithm and visualizes the solution path.
🚀 Features
Maze Representation: Mazes are 2D NumPy arrays (1 for walls, 0 for paths).
User Input: Define start and end coordinates for the maze.
Solver: Employs a recursive backtracking algorithm to find a path.
Visualization: Displays the maze and solution path using matplotlib.
